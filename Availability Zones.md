### ✅ First: Yes, **"the cloud is just someone else's computer"** — more specifically:

* It’s a **data center full of servers** (machines) owned by AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.
* When you deploy something like a **Lambda**, it **runs on one of those servers**, but **you don’t see or manage** the actual machine.
* You just provide code; AWS decides **where exactly to run it**, within the region you choose.

---

### 🌍 What is a Region?

A **Region** is a **geographic location** (like `us-east-1` = North Virginia, or `eu-west-1` = Ireland).
Each region is made up of **Availability Zones**.

---

### 🏢 What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?

An **Availability Zone** is a **physical data center or a group of very close data centers** within a region.

* So when you see:

  * `us-east-1a`
  * `us-east-1b`
  * `us-east-1c`

  These are **separate buildings or locations** in the same area (North Virginia), but far enough apart that a power outage in one doesn’t affect the others.

---

### 📦 Why Do Subnets Use Availability Zones?

When you create a **VPC**, you typically:

* Divide your **IP range** into **subnets**
* Place those subnets in different **Availability Zones**

Example:

```plaintext
VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  Subnet-A: 10.0.1.0/24 -> us-east-1a
  Subnet-B: 10.0.2.0/24 -> us-east-1b
  Subnet-C: 10.0.3.0/24 -> us-east-1c
```

💡 **Why?**
To make your infrastructure **highly available**:

* If a **machine or whole zone goes down**, other zones are still running.
* Think of it like having your app in **3 different buildings in the same city**: if one catches fire, your service continues from the others.

---

### 🔄 Are Availability Zones in Different Regions?

No — all AZs in a region are:

* In the **same general geographic area**
* **Connected with high-speed fiber**
* But still **physically separate**

If you want to span **multiple countries or continents**, then you use **multiple regions**, not just AZs.

---

### 🔌 When You Deploy in Multiple AZs, What Happens?

Let’s say you deploy a **load-balanced app** in 3 AZs:

* AWS puts your **EC2/Lambda/Database** in different buildings
* The **load balancer** sends traffic across them
* If one AZ fails, AWS automatically uses the others

You don’t **see** the physical servers, but your **architecture gets more resilience**.

---

### ✅ TL;DR:

* **Availability Zones = Real-world separate data centers** inside a region
* Subnets in different AZs = **Spreading your infrastructure for fault tolerance**
* More AZs ≠ more regions — still the same region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
* You’re not in 3 countries — you’re in **3 nearby but separate buildings in the same general location**
