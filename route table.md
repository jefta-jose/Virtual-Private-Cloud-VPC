### ✅ What `0.0.0.0/0` Actually Does

* It means:

  > “**Send traffic going anywhere that's not in the VPC** out through this target (IGW or NAT Gateway).”

* It's only for **outbound routing** — sending **from your subnet** to the internet.

---

### 🚫 What `0.0.0.0/0` **Does NOT Do**

* It does **NOT handle incoming traffic** by itself.
* Incoming traffic **is not controlled** by route tables with `0.0.0.0/0`.

### 🚪 So Who Controls **Incoming Traffic**?

| Component                  | Role                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Allows **inbound and outbound** traffic from/to internet                 |
| **Public IP**              | Needed for internet to find your instance                                |
| **Security Group**         | Must explicitly allow the port (e.g., SSH on port 22)                    |
| **Route Table**            | Just builds the "outgoing road" to the internet (like `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`) |

### 🧠 Key Insight:

| Setup                     | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`         | Lets your instance talk to internet + prepares for incoming (if allowed) |
| `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway` | Lets **private** instance talk to internet (no incoming allowed)         |
| Incoming traffic          | Depends on IGW + Public IP + Security Group — **not** `0.0.0.0/0` route  |

### 🧭 Think of `0.0.0.0/0` like:

> "If we don’t know where else to send the traffic, send it to the **outside world** (internet)."

But the **internet can only talk back if you explicitly allow it**.
